<h1>Client documentation</h1>

<p>
  Arkheia offers users a convenient way of organizing, exploring and publishing
  their neural simulation specifications and results via a dedicated web
  application. In this section of the documentation we will explain to the user
  the web-based GUI frontend. To find out how to install and deploy Arkheia
  please refer to the
  <a href="./install.html">Installation &amp; Deployment</a> section of the
  documentation. The Arkheia follows the common client-server architecture. To
  learn how to communicate with the server, and extend Arkheia to be compatible
  with your favorite simulation work-flow, please refer to the
  <a href="/documentation/api">API</a> part of the documentation. Furthermore,
  if you want to learn more about the motivations behind Arkheia design, or gain
  inspiration for various possible use-cases, read the
  <a href="placeholder?">Arkheia manuscript</a>. Should you use Arkheia in your
  scientific project resulting in publication, please cite this paper.

<h2>Landing page</h2>

<p>
  When accessing an instance of Arkheia repository, user will first see the
  landing page depicted in figure 1. This page can be always accessed again via
  the <em>About</em> item of the top menu strip, or upon clicking the Arkheia
  logo on the left side of the top menu strip.

  <em>Figure 1: About page.</em>
</p>

<p>
  The center of the landing page is occupied with the welcome message that can
  be customized by the user to tell visitors basic information about the given
  repository instance (Fig 1.1), refer to
  <a href="/documentation/api">API</a> on how to populate the message. The
  Arkheia <a href="/documentation">documentation</a> can be accessed via the
  <em>Documentation</em> item in the top menu strip (Fig 1.4). Arkheia
  facilitates sharing of two types of simulation results:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Individual simulation runs can be accessed via the
    <em>Simulation runs</em> item of the top menu strip (Fig 1.2).
  </li>
  <li>
    Sets of simulation runs resulting from parameter searches can be accessed
    via the <em>Parameter searches</em> item of the top menu strip (Fig 1.3).
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>
  The documentation page contains links to three parts of the Arkheia project
  documentation: 1. the documentation of the client web-based user interface
  (Fig 2.1) that you are currently viewing 2. the documentation of the
  <a href="/documentation/api">API</a> specification (Fig 2.2) with which user
  can access the Arkheia database and thus use to integrate Arkheia with his
  favorite simulation tools 3. the installation &amp; deployment guideline
  outlining several different use-cases for Arkheia usage accompanied by
  step-by-step instructions (Fig 2.3)

<h2>Individual simulation runs page</h2>

<p>
  The <em>simulation runs</em> page offers a simple tabular representation of
  the set of simulation runs that were submitted to the repository, with each
  row corresponding to single simulation run, and each column representing one
  simulation run property. The first four columns tell user (in this order) when
  the given simulation run was submitted to the repository (Fig 3.1), when was
  the actual simulation executed (Fig 3.2), the name the user gave to that
  specific simulation run (Fig 3.3) and the name of the model that was simulated
  (Fig 3.4). The next five columns contain links (the 'eye' icons) that take the
  user to pages further exploring the content of the given simulation run. From
  left to right, user can view the description of the model (Fig 3.5), explore
  the full parametrization of the simulation (Fog 3.6), view all the stimuli
  that have been presented to the model (Fig 3.7), explore all the experimental
  protocols that have been executed on the model during the simulation (Fig
  3.8), and finally view the results that have been generated during the
  simulation (Fig 3.9). The last column containing the 'download' icons allows
  users to download the entire Arkheia document associated with the given
  simulation run (Fig 3.10). It comes bundled in a zip file together with the
  associated results figures.
</p>

<p>
  Note that throughout the web-application you will encounter many similar
  tabular views, and in most cases the columns will be annotated with short
  tool-tips briefly explaining what does the given column represent. In most of
  these tabular views, just like here in <em>simulation runs</em>, user will
  also be able to sort the table based on a selected column by clicking on it's
  header name. Below the header name, user can also find an input window which
  allows him to filter results based on entered string.
</p>

<p>
  Finally the 'search' icon in the header of the web-page allows user to filter
  the simulation runs based on any chosen attribute stored in the nested
  dictionary format of the Arkheia document. Upon clicking it a text input
  appears in which user can enter filter queries in the following format:
</p>

<pre><code>comma.separated.path.to.the.attribute.to.filter.by the_desired_value_for_the_attribute
</code></pre>

<p>
  For example to only select simulations that included
  'FullfieldDriftingSinusoidalGrating' stimulus one can enter following query:
</p>

<pre><code>stimuli.code FullfieldDriftingSinusoidalGrating
</code></pre>

<h2>The parameters page</h2>

<p>
  Arkheia allows demonstration of the simulation's parametric configuration in
  the form of a tree structure. The parameter exploration page provides a
  classic tree-view graphical user interface with which user can conveniently
  explore this tree of parameters. The nodes marked with + sign can be expanded
  upon clicking the icon (Fig 4.1), the nodes marked by the - sign can be
  collapsed (Fig 4.2). The leafs of the tree (marked by square icon) contain the
  value of the parameter defined by the path to the given leaf (Fig 4.3). The
  value is treated by Arkheia as an arbitrary string, thus Arkheia back-ends can
  convey extra information to the value of the parameters, such as their type,
  or as depicted in Fig 4.3 express that the parameter is not a constant value
  but a distribution.

<h2>The stimulus view page</h2>

<p>
  This page lets user to explore all stimuli that have been presented to the
  model during the simulation. It is organized in the same tabular manner as the
  <em>Individual simulation runs</em> page. The first column show the name of
  the stimulus (this should ideally correspond to the name of the code (e.g.
  class or function)) that generates it (Fig 5.1). Second column contains a
  short description of the stimulus directly visible in the table (Fig 5.2),
  while the third column contains longer description viewable upon clicking the
  corresponding 'eye' icon (Fig 5.3). The fourth column contains links that show
  upon clicking the list of parameters and their values of the given stimulus in
  a pop-up panel (Fig 5.4). Finally, the fifth column contains small thumbnails
  of the actual stimulus that was presented to the model (Fig 5.5).

<h2>Experimental protocols page</h2>

<p>
  This page is again organized in the now familiar tabular manner, this time
  listing experimental protocols that were conducted during the simulation (top
  of the page) and the recording configurations describing what has been
  recorded and where during the simulation. For the experimental protocols 4
  properties are listed, the reference to the source code corresponding to the
  invocation of the given experimental protocols (Fig 7.1; this is typically a
  name of a class or a function), a short description of the protocol (Fig 7.2),
  longer description that can be expanded and retracted upon selecting the 'eye'
  icon (Fig 7.3), and the parameter values that the specific protocol was
  invoked with that show up as an pop-up upon selecting the corresponding 'eye'
  icon (Fig 7.4).

  <em>Figure 7: Experimental protocols page.</em>
</p>

<p>
  The recording configurations section of the page is a bit more structured,
  listing 6 different properties, starting again with the reference to the
  source code which is responsible for the given recording configuration (Fig
  7.5), the name of the target population of neurons in which the recording was
  performed (Fig 7.6), the list of signals that were recorded (e.g. spikes,
  membrane potential etc.) (Fig 7.7), short (Fig 7.8) and long (Fig 7.9)
  description of the recording configuration, and the list of parameter values
  with which the recording configuration was invoked with (Fig 7.10), which
  appear as a pop-up upon clicking the corresponding 'eye' icon (Fig 8).

</p>

<h2>Results page</h2>

<p>
  The results page lets user browse figures that have been generated during the
  simulation. For each figure, the page lists the reference to the source code
  responsible for generating the figure (Fig 9.1,this can be a class or function
  name for example), the name of the figure assigned by user (Fig 9.2), and
  finally the right-most column contains the thumbnails of the figures.

<p>
  Upon clicking the thumbnails, the figure is displayed at full size (Fig 10).
  At the top of the full-size panel, user can navigate through the other figures
  generated during the simulation without leaving the full-size view:

</p>

<h2>Parameter search page</h2>

<p>
  The parameter search page is very similar to the
  <em>Individual simulation runs page</em>, except that instead of listing
  individual simulations runs, it list sets of simulation runs originating from
  a systematic parameter search. The first four columns thus tell user (in this
  order) when the given parameter search was submitted to the repository (Fig
  11.1), when was the actual parameter search executed (Fig 11.2), the name the
  user gave to that specific parameter search (Fig 11.3) and the name of the
  model that was simulated (Fig 11.4). The 'eye' icons in the fifth column take
  the user to a view which is identical to the
  <em>Individual simulation runs page</em>, but listing only simulation runs
  from the given parameter search (Fig 11.5). Finally they 'eye' icons in the
  fifth column pass the user to an interactive view in which the user can
  explore the results as a function of the parameter values that have been
  varied throughout the parameter search.

<h2>Parameter search inspect page</h2>

<p><a id="psip-anchor"></a></p>

<p>
  This page allows users to interactively explore the results that originate in
  a series of simulations in which the parameters of the simulation were
  systematically varied. Currently only grid-like searches of parameters are
  supported. Broadly, the page is dived into two horizontal panels, the top
  containing various control elements (Fig 12,1-4), and the bottom panel
  containing the actual view of the parameter search results (Fig 12,5-7). The
  bottom view always contains set of instances of a specific figure that was
  generated during the simulations in the parameter search. The figure instances
  are arranged into grid (Fig 12.5), such that the values of parameters assigned
  to the two axis of the grid orderly vary along the axis, thus allowing user to
  gain insight into how do the properties of the simulations depicted in the
  selected figure change with the changing parameter values. The vertical axes
  of the grid always corresponds to a single parameter (Fig 12.6), while the
  horizontal axis corresponds to the remaining parameters whose values are
  hierarchically ordered (Fig 12.7). Usually the figures corresponding to all
  the explored parameter combinations cannot be viewed within the screen at the
  same time, but user needs to scroll around the grid, however the horizontal
  and vertical guides will automatically scroll in-sync with the grid to provide
  user a matching guide as to which parameter value combinations generated the
  viewed figures.

</p>

<p>
  In the top panel user can manipulate the exact information viewed in the
  figure grid at the bottom. User can select which of the multiple figures
  generated for each simulation within the parameter search to display (Fig
  12.1). User can adjust the size of the individual figures in the grid to gain
  appropriate view of the information depicted in them (Fig 12.2). Below, the
  list of the parameters that varied during parameter search is displayed (Fig
  12.3; any parameters that did not vary are automatically excluded by Arkheia).
  Upon clicking any of the parameter names, that parameter is selected to be
  viewed along the y-axis of the grid, while remaining are assigned to the
  x-axis. Furthermore, next to each parameter the list of different values that
  were assigned to the parameter during the search are displayed. Each can be
  clicked, by which user toggles whether that parameter value should be included
  in the grid or not. Any parameters for which single value remains selected are
  automatically removed from the horizontal guideline (unless it is selected for
  the vertical guideline) in order to reduce clutter. This way user can flexibly
  select different slices through the multi-dimensional parameter search space
  which can be powerful way to gain insight into such inherently complex data.
  The parameter list panel can be disabled to gain more space for viewing of the
  grid (Fig 12.4). Finally upon clicking on any of the figures in the grid view,
  the figure will be displayed at full-size in a pop-over panel, which will at
  the top also contains controls for navigating through all the other figures
  that the given simulation run (i.e. corresponding to the given combination of
  parameter values) generated (Fig 13).
